# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

# The default link to DATABASE_URL is "postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
# Update this link with the one provided by Heroku
# Inside Heroku -> Add "Heroku Postgres" add-on, then click on the link, go to Settings -> Administration -> Database Credentials -> View Credentials -> Copy the URI

# Prisma does its migration called shadow databses where it creates a new database
# On Heroku free tier you can not create a new database with a user assigned to that particular instance of "Heroku Postgres" add-on, however, you can only have multiple instances of "Heroku Postgres" add-on
# In Heroku grab the other database URI

# If you use postgres on your local system, make sure that the assigned user has admin permissions to create a database, and then you won't need any additional SHADOW_DATABSE_URL
